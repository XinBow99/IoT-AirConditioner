# IoT-AirConditioner

* IoT-AirConditioner is a base on Arduino program.
* Someday, the AirConditioner remote control was near broken. So i made this program.
* For instance, the temperature setting range of the air-conditioning remote control is 20 to 32. Because the remote control is broken, I can only get the codes of 25, 26, and 29, so I collect the hex codes of these three values ​​and make a guess And verify, finally get all the temperature codes.
